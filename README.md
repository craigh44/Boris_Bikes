#Boris Bikes

First task at Makers Academy, 


I am creating a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London. My system will keep track of a number of docking stations and the bikes. It will allow you to rent the bikes and return them. Occasionally the bikes will break and then they will be unavailable for rental. There will also be a garage to fix the bikes and a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.
